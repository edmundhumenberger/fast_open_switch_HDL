## I2C Assembly script directory

This directory contains a variety of scripts to generate files that can be
used with I2C ASM, as found in the [WBI2C](https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c)
project.  Please see that project for the reference of how to read these
I2C scripts, and how to generate them into either binaries or (as they are
used here) into various .c files.
